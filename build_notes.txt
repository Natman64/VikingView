Windows 32-bit:

Tested development environment:

1) Visual Studio 9 (2008).  Everything should works with newer versions of Visual Studio.

2) Qt 4.8.x.  The latest Qt4 should be used.  It's probably not difficult to upgrade it Qt5, but I haven't seen any reason to.

3) CMake 2.8+.  Any recent version of CMake should be fine.

4) VTK 6.  Any version of VTK 6 should be fine.
  * Make sure to build with Qt support

5) Sample cmake configuration command:

cmake ../src -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" -DVTK_DIR="C:/path/to/vtk-6.1.0-x86"

To deploy, we use CPack+NSIS.

1) You may need to install NSIS separately in order for CPack to use it.

2) Run:

cpack -G NSIS
